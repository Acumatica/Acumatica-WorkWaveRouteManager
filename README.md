WorkWave Route Manager Integration
==================================

# ðŸš« This repository has been archived 
As of 2023 R2, Acumatica discontinued maintenance of the WorkWave Route Manager integration. As a result, this integration is no longer officially sold or supported by Acumatica. The source code is available here on GitHub for partners or customers who are interested in expanding the integration for their own use cases. For assistance, partners or customers may [contact Sprinterra](https://www.sprinterra.com/contact-us/) to customize or upgrade to be compatible with future Acumatica versions.
